# Data Input Using ESP32 to HTML Form

2 types of HTML forms:

1.  The one that handles input data
2.  The one that also stores input data in SIPIFFS

Upload the sketch to the ESP32 after it has been successfully compiled, and then open the serial monitor to obtain the web server's IP address.

We will see a view of the HTML form with three input fields after entering the IP address into the web server.
